Problem Statement
Given an array A[], of size N containing positive integers. You need to print the elements of array in increasing order.
Input
First line of the input denotes the number of test cases 'T'. First line of the test case is the size of array and second line consists of array elements.

For Python Users just complete the given function

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= A[i] <= 10^3
Output
For each testcase print the sorted array in a new line.
Example
```
Input:
2
5
4 1 3 9 7
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Output:
1 3 4 7 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Explanation:
Testcase 1: 1 3 4 7 9 are in sorted form.
Testcase 2: For the given input , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 are in sorted form.
